# Internet Availability Crawler (Greece)

This program crawls [Cosmote's](https://www.cosmote.gr/selfcare/jsp/diathesimotita-adsl-vdsl-cosmotetv.jsp?ct=bus#) API to fetch data for internet speed availability in Greece.

## How it works
Greek states are stored under `data/stateList.json` where you can see the number correlating to each state.

## How it works

1. ```stateCrawler.js```

   ```bash
   node stateCrawler.js 39
   ```

   ```bash
   node stateCrawler.js all
   ```

  __stateCrawler.js__ _is deployed in order to fetch all municipalities of chosen state. You must give one argument, either a specific number (not state name) or just type 'all' to fetch all municipalities of state._

  > Data generated by `stateCrawler.js` is stored under `./generated/state_39/municipalities.json` note that where _39_ is written, given state id will be added.
  <br>File `data/stateList.json` has a property called `municipalitiesFilePath` that stores the path to generated municipalities in order to know where it is stored.

2. ```municipalityCrawler.js```

   ```bash
   node municipalityCrawler.js 39 417
   ```

   ```bash
   node municipalityCrawler.js 39 all
   ```

   ```bash
   node municipalityCrawler.js all
   ```
   
   __municipalityCrawler.js__ _is deployed in order to fetch all streets in chosen municipality. You must give two arguments, first argument must be a specific number (not state name) or just type all to fetch all streets in all municipalities. Given you have not entered all as first argument you can give as second argument a specific number (not municipality name) or just type all to fetch all streets in selected municipality._

  > Data generated by `municipalityCrawler.js` is stored under `./generated/state_39/streets/streets_of_municipality_893.json` note that where _893_ is written, given municipality id will be added.<br>
  File `./generated/state_39/municipalities.json` has a property called `streetsFilePath` that stores the path to generated streets in order to know where it is stored.

3. ```prefectureCrawler.js```

   ```bash
   node prefectureCrawler.js 39 417
   ```

   ```bash
   node prefectureCrawler.js 39 all
   ```

   ```bash
   node prefectureCrawler.js all
   ```
   
   __prefectureCrawler.js__ _is deployed in order to fetch all street prefectures in chosen municipality. You must give two arguments, first argument must be a specific number (not state name) or just type all to fetch all street prefectures in all municipalities. Given you have not entered all as first argument you can give as second argument a specific number (not municipality name) or just type all to fetch all street prefectures in selected municipality._

   > Streets object has a property called prefectures where prefectures are stored as follows:
   ```JSON
   "prefecture": {
         "name": "ΑΓ. ΙΩΑΝΝΗΣ ΚΝΩΣΣΟΥ",
         "id": "93214"
   }
   ```

4. ```speedAvailabilityCrawler.js```

   ```bash
   node speedAvailabilityCrawler.js 39 417 fast
   ```

   ```bash
   node speedAvailabilityCrawler.js 39 all
   ```

   ```bash
   node speedAvailabilityCrawler.js all
   ```
   
   __speedAvailabilityCrawler.js__ _is deployed in order to fetch all available speeds of given street in chosen municipality. You must give two arguments, first argument must be a specific number (not state name) or just type all to fetch all available speeds of given street in all municipalities. Given you have not entered all as first argument you can give as second argument a specific number (not municipality name) or just type all to fetch all available speeds of given street in selected municipality. In addition fafst argument can be given to crawl through a smaller amount of street numbers (it is optional).
   
   > Streets object has an array property called speeds where speeds by street number are stored as follows:
   ```JSON
    "speeds": [
            {
                "streetNumber": "9",
                "networkAvailability": {
                    "speed200": false,
                    "speed100": false,
                    "speed50": true,
                    "speed24": true
                }
            }
        ]
   ```
